# NotesApp
UI and server for notes app

With this app iphone user can create, modify and delete notes.
Alamofire is used to fetch data, Node.js and express.js are used to make server. Data is stored in a local database, MongoDB is used. 

Through this app I learnt:
- how to use dependencies (Alamofire)
- how start a server using Node.js and express.js
- how to set up and connect to a local database using MongoDB
